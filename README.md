# Chrome Extensions

Basic framework for creating your own Google Chrome extensions:<br>
<br>-The ```manifest.json``` file contains the metadata for the extension, such as its name, version, and permissions.
<br>-The ```icon.png``` file is the icon for the extension.
<br>-The ```popup.html``` file contains the HTML code for the popup window that will be displayed when the user clicks on the extension icon.
<br>-The ```popup.css``` file contains the CSS styles for the popup window.
<br>-The ```popup.js``` file contains the JavaScript code for the popup window.
<br>-The ```background.js``` file contains the JavaScript code that runs in the background of the extension.

Load your extension into Chrome:

**Open the Chrome Extension Management page** by typing "chrome://extensions" into the address bar and pressing Enter<br>
**Enable Developer Mode** by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner of the page.<br>
**Click the "Load unpacked" button** and select the folder that contains your extension files.<br>
<br>Test your extension:

Open a new tab in Chrome and click on the extension icon to open the popup window.
Make sure that the extension is working as expected.
